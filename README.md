A biometric(image) processing lib, based on opencv

Functions:

* database connection (mysql)
     - dbconnection*
     
* detect the mask face using SVM
     - masked_face_detection*
     
* PCA and LBPH alg are used to face recognizion
     - eigenfaces*


* Centroid-based partitioning (Hierarchical Clustering) and multi-probe LSH algorithm examples based on the FLANN library
     - flann*

* iris for the biometric
     - focus on the binary feature generation
